    "# Workflow Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This workflow is designed to manage and update a dataset of immigration records. It includes functionality to:\n",
    "1. Display the timestamp of the last recorded entry.\n",
    "2. Allow the user to add a new record interactively.\n",
    "3. Update a text file (`last_extraction.txt`) with the timestamp of the last record.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Load the Dataset\n",
    "- The dataset is loaded from a CSV file located at `K:\\Code Projects\\ETL_Extract_Justice_Chawanda_670444\\Immigration_Data.csv`.\n",
    "- If the dataset is empty, a message is written to the `last_extraction.txt` file indicating that the dataset is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Display the Last Recorded Timestamp\n",
    "- If the dataset is not empty, the timestamp of the last record is retrieved and written to the `last_extraction.txt` file.\n",
    "- This ensures that the file always reflects the most recent update.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Add a New Record\n",
    "- The user is prompted to decide whether they want to add a new record.\n",
    "- If the user chooses \"yes\":\n",
    "  - The user is asked to input details for the new record, including:\n",
    "    - Immigrant ID\n",
    "    - Passport Number\n",
    "    - Name\n",
    "    - Country\n",
    "    - Purpose of Visit\n",
    "    - Contact\n",
    "    - Payment Status\n",
    "  - The current timestamp is automatically added to the record.\n",
    "  - The new record is appended to the dataset.\n",
    "  - The updated dataset is saved back to the CSV file.\n",
    "  - The `last_extraction.txt` file is updated with the timestamp of the newly added record.\n",
    "- If the user chooses \"no\":\n",
    "  - A message \"No new record added.\" is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Used\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `Immigration_Data.csv`\n",
    "- Stores the dataset of immigration records.\n",
    "- Updated whenever a new record is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `last_extraction.txt`\n",
    "- Stores the timestamp of the last recorded entry.\n",
    "- Updated every time the workflow is executed, regardless of whether a new record is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Ensures the dataset and `last_extraction.txt` file are always in sync.\n",
    "- Provides an interactive way to manage records.\n",
    "- Handles empty datasets gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Improvements\n",
    "- Add validation for user inputs to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- Implement logging to track changes to the dataset.\n",
    "- Provide an option to delete or update existing records."
